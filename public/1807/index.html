            <p>This is a write up for a D&D session run by <a href="http://untimately.blogspot.ca/">Brendan of Untimately</a> fame. The two hour game took place over Google+. The session was part of a <a href="http://jrients.blogspot.ca/2011/08/flailsnails-conventions.html">Flailsnails</a> game to rescue <a href="http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.ca/2012/11/last-chauncy-in-carcosa-very-special.html">Gustie's Wampus County character Chauncy</a>.</p>
            <p>You can read Brendan's write up of the encounter on his blog: <a href="http://untimately.blogspot.ca/2012/11/wandering-in-carcosa_5.html">Wandering in Carcosa</a>. I expect in the near future the whole adventure will be available for download.</p>

            <p class='location'>1807</p>
            <p class='description'>A Bone Man (AC 3, MV 60', HD 1+1, Lawful) and a Jale Women (AC 9, MV 120', HD 1+1, Neutral) explore the badlands in search of alien technology for their war tribe.</p>
            <p class='description'>A party of 2-8 inter-dimensional travelers search for their lost companion. They are armed with turn of the century firearms: pistols & shotguns. They are cautious around and distrustful of any natives of Carcosa they encounter. They will however aid anyone who agrees to help them find their friend.</p>
            <p class='description'>3-18 red orbs can be seen floating in the distance.</p>
            <p class='description'>2 Unquiet Worms make their home in the shade of a disabled alien tank. Within the tank, two dead aliens lay mummified in their spacesuits. Sufficiently intelligent creatures can restore the tank to working order after 2-6 turns of experimentation.</p>
            <p class='description'>Trails of small insects converge on the rocky husk of a massive dead insect. Within an inter-dimensional traveler to Carcosa lays shackled to the ground. Insects crawl in and out of his body. A sorcerer and his minions are in the middle of casting the ritual <em>Canticle of the Crawling God</em>. They will summon the Crawling God in 1-3 hours.                  </p>
