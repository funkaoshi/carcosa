        <h1 id="generation-of-detailed-carcosa-hex-maps-by-doyle-wayne-ramos-tavener">Generation of Detailed <em>Carcosa</em> Hex Maps</h1>
    
        <h3>By Doyle Wayne-Ramos Tavener</h3>
        
        <p>Based upon <em>Carsosa</em>, by Geoffrey McKinney with Chris Robert. Thanks to Jeff Rients for his Carcosan Color Chart.</p>
        <p>Version 1.1</p>
        
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

        <p>This document is a set of guidelines for expanding the 10 mile hexes in <em>Carcosa</em> into maps of 25 x 33 704 yard hexes. While these guidelines will not do all the work for you, using them will allow you to produce, with a little time and effort, something close to the description of Hex 2005 in the revised <em>Carcosa</em>. If you do produce such a map and/or its descriptions, the Carcosan gaming community would love for you to share them, thus lightening the creative load for all.</p>

        <h2 id="initial-steps">Initial Steps</h2>

        <p>First, pick a 10 mile hex from the large scale <em>Carcosa</em> map. Note its dominant terrain and any information listed from the hex map descriptions. Pay special attention to the descriptions of any rituals for the hex, as these often contain more information about dungeons, underground locations, weird places above ground, etc. of the hex. You may also wish to consider the terrain and features of the surrounding six hexes, to see if they would impinge in any way on the environment of the hex in question.</p>

        <h2 id="creating-the-map">Creating the Map</h2>

        <p>Then take a blank hex map sheet. It should have 25 rows, and 33 columns of hexes, or something close to this. <a href="https://www.judgesguild.org/downloads/Blank%20Hex%20Sheets.pdf">You can find one as of October, 2014, at the Judges Guild website.</a></p>

        <p>Now consider the dominant terrain of the hex. By this I mean what terrain is actually pictured on the hex in the large scale map? Is it as mix of terrain? </p>

        <h2 id="filling-in-the-hex">Filling in the Hex</h2>

        <p>Using the large scale hex as your guide, fill in one of every six or so hexes with the appropriate color, based on the terrain. At this point, you are filling in a framework of what the hex looks like. I use the following color scheme, but you can choose your own. Alternately, you can use symbol for your terrain, and keep everything in black or white, but color does aid the clarity of the map. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Snow: Light Blue</li>
            <li>Desert: Soft Yellow</li>
            <li>Radioactive Desert: Bright Yellow</li>
            <li>Forest: Light Green (I also usually draw small tree symbols)</li>
            <li>Hills: Light Brown (with symbols)</li>
            <li>Mountains: Dark Brown (with symbols)</li>
            <li>Waste: Gray</li>
            <li>Jungle Dark Green (with symbols)</li>
            <li>Swamp: Blue-Green</li>
            <li>Water: Deep Blue</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For anything else (i.e. clear terrain) I leave the hex blank.</p>

        <p>There are software programs that allow you create these maps electronically. Using these programs to create your hex maps will allow easy sharing of them (you don’t have to scan the final product, so the files size will probably be lower). <a href="https://www.hexographer.com/"><em>Hexographer</em></a> in particular makes this process much easier, but some prefer the look of hand-drawn maps. </p>

        <h2 id="placing-features">Placing Features</h2>

        <p>Then, place the two features listed in <em>Carcosa</em> for the hex. Remember to check the ritual descriptions! This might add to the number of features in the hex. Place a unique symbol, or a letter or number code, to act a reference for each feature.</p>

        <p>Then, roll 1d8 to determine the amount of additional features in the hex. This will give an average of four to five features, plus the initial two for a total of 6 - 7. If you want to have a higher average, use a larger die, or some combination (like 2d4 or even 2d6). </p>

        <p>Place the features more or less randomly on your map. If you want to use a random method, you can use the one detailed below, or use some other method according to your preference. </p>

        <p>Using one of the features already placed on the map as a starting point, roll 1d6 and 1d12. The d6 roll determines a direction in hex sides, using the top as number 1. The d12 indicates how many hexes in the direction determined the next feature will be placed. If you go off the edge of the map, stop in the last hex, or pivot to the right or the left of the edge and continue counting. Repeat this process for about half the amount of features rolled, then use the second feature discussed in <em>Carcosa</em> (or one of the features mentioned in a ritual) as the starting point of the other features. </p>

        <p>Then determine the actual features involved according to the chart and sub-charts below: </p>

        <h2 id="ruins">Ruins</h2>

        <p>A ruined structure or settlement of one of the pre-human civilizations of Carcosa. Roll on the following chart to determine the type of ruin. These structures need not be inhabited by the race that built them. More likely than not, they will have monsters and ‘gods’ within them. Some of the less dangerous ones will be inhabited by Men, and some will be ‘dungeons’.</p>

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Great Race</strong> – Great Race ruins are usually their cyclopean cities that extend far beneath the surface of Carcosa. The uppermost levels, due to changes in the shape of the planet over the eons, will have become thrust up and protrude onto the surface. It is said that in addition to the remnants of the Great Race, the creatures that hunted them nigh unto extinction are also found here. </p>

        <p><strong>Primordial Ones</strong> – Primordial Ones ruins, outside of their cyclopean cities in the polar regions of Carcosa, are usually enclaves, or small outposts maintained for some military or scientific reason. </p>

        <p><strong>Deep Ones</strong> – Deep One Ruins are usually beneath the seas of Carcosa, but there are certainly some ruins that the seas have abandoned, leaving the non-Euclidian geometry of the Deep One cities exposed.</p>

        <p><strong>Snake Men</strong> – Snake Men ruins compose the most common ruins on Carcosa. Their inhuman cities, made of nigh-imperishable materials, still over-awe humanity today. These ruins comprise all sorts: vast cites, single outposts, towers of Sorcerers, vast temples, and perhaps even more disturbing, pits and dungeons that still feel… homey to the vast bulk of men. Many of the smaller structures are now, in fact, the basis of the castles and citadels used today by men. Other ruins are less… hospitable.</p>

        <p><strong>Space Alien</strong> – Ruins of the Space Aliens are among the most varied. These strange beings established very few cites, so most of their ‘ruins’ are in fact small outposts, enclaves, or more commonly, the strange vessels that carried them to Carcosa from the outer gulfs. There is a small chance (5 – 10%) that they still contain some un-plundered bit of high technology. </p>

        <h2 id="dungeons-in-carcosa">Dungeons in Carcosa</h2>

        <p>If you don’t like the traditional notions of ‘dungeons’ in Carcosa campaigns, that of multi-level mazes filled with monsters and treasure, you don’t have to present them as such. Most of the dungeons in my own campaign have been presented as ruins along the lines detailed here, along with mixtures of the of the various types. The players in my campaign are currently exploring the ‘Fane of Yog-Sothoth’, which is a snake-man ruin inhabited by degenerate purple-men and weird undead, as well as some spawn of Shub-Niggurath.</p>

        <h2 id="geographical-features">Geographical Features</h2>

        <p>Carcosa is world filled with the strange, the weird and the amazing. This extends to various features of the environment, as much as the outré inhabitants. Roll on the chart below to determine the feature. Most of the entries do not involve sub-tables, as the placement of most of these features will be dependent upon the terrain of the hex where they are found.</p>

        <p><strong>Lake or Other Waterway</strong> – Lake and other sorts of waterways seem relatively rare on Carcosa. Nonetheless there is certainly some water, and most sources are probably too small to portray on the 10 mile per hex scale. Such bodies of water may vary from ponds a few hundred feet across or less, to lakes that are 3-5 704 yard hexes in size, but probably not much wider. The Snake-men or other pre-human cultures may have built aqueducts, underground cisterns, or dams while small creeks and rivers undoubtedly exist in some areas. Such areas come with their own dangers, such as Deep Ones, Amphibious Ones, mutant plesiosaurs, gigantic slimes or jellies, etc. </p>

        <p><strong>Canyon or Depression</strong> – While no vast canyons on the scale of the Grand Canyon or the Snake River Canyon have yet been described on Carcosa, various small canyons do exist, many of which have caves or tunnels built into their sides. Pits, vast depressions, open sinkholes and the like are even more common. Many of these will be inhabited or perhaps contain ruins. </p>

        <p><strong>Sinkhole or Treacherous Ground</strong> –This could be a sudden appearance of a sinkhole, or quicksand, geyser riddled tundra or flatulent swamps. Such hazards might require saving throws or search rolls to avoid, depending on the Judge’s view of the circumstances. </p>

        <p><strong>Unusual Flora</strong> – The flora of Carcosa is relatively simple compared to that of Earth. Molds, algae, and fungi predominate. There are trees, but they are alien and partly fungal in appearance. Some are more dangerous than others, and a few produce substances that are useful to humanity.</p>

        <p><strong>Strange Weather Phenomenon</strong> – Carcosan weather has not been much described, and will often depend on the terrain of the hex involved. The chart below may need to be modified, depending on the hex where it occurs. Seasons have not been mentioned in previous Carcosan texts, but that does not mean that they don’t exist in your campaign. Adjust accordingly. Note that this is not a weather chart per se, to be rolled every day, but only an example of truly strange weather phenomena that might be encounter on Carcosa.</p>

        <p><em>Unusual Astronomical Event</em> – This could be an eclipse, a nova appearing in the sky, or perhaps a pitched battle between the Space Aliens and some unknown foe, visible on the surface of Carcosa.</p>

        <p><em>Unusual Rain</em> – This might a rain of blood, frogs, fire, acid, or perhaps most infrequently, cool, refreshing water.</p>

        <p><em>Extraordinary Winds</em> – Powerful winds that could be the result of sandstorms, tornadoes or other meteorological phenomena. Generally, the most extreme of such winds will require a successful saving throw to continue to move, possibly resulting in serious damage on a failed save. </p>

        <p><em>Odd or Unusual Mist</em> – Strange mists that randomly pass over an area might simply be condensation, which obscures vision, or they might be a cloud with weaponized mutagenic particles that requires a save vs. poison to avoid acquiring a random mutation. Other mists might hide strange races or horrible monsters…</p>

        <p><strong>Earthquake</strong> – While Carcosa is not especially more tectonically active than present day earth, the crust is riddled with vast underground chambers, cities, subterranean roads and most disturbingly vast entities whose movements provoke localized earthquakes. Usually, a saving throw is necessary to keep from being thrown to the ground, though the consequences can be greater when in an unstable structure or cabin. . </p>

        <p><strong>Radioactivity or Toxic Contamination</strong> – The strength and severity of the exposure can usually be measured in the frequency of saving throws to avoid damage or ability loss. The most severe might require a save every hour, where light exposure might require a save once a week or even once month. </p>

        <p><strong>Colossal Structure</strong> – Carcosa is littered with cyclopean structures that are of mysterious origin, perhaps even to the extinct Snake-Men, much less humanity. These structures may be many multiples of 704 yard hexes in both width and length. The following table is meant to suggest possibilities, as these sorts of structures should probably be generated from scratch, rather than through random tables. </p>

        <p>Their leader will be a Fighter (1-5 on 1d6) or a Sorcerer (6 on a 1d6) of level 2 – 12 (2d6). Roll 1d6 to determine the alignment of the leader. If a Fighter, there is a two in six chance for each of the alignments. The leader will usually be armed with a melee weapon and bear plate mail and shield (AC 19) or a two-handed weapon and plate mail (AC 18). </p>

        <p>If the ruler is a Sorcerer, he will be Chaotic on a 1-4, Neutral on a 5, and Lawful on a 6. The alignment of the raiders usually matches that of the ruler.</p>

        <p>Roll on the race chart to determine the race of the men involved.</p>

        <p>The leader will usually have 1d6 guards of level 1-6, armed with a melee weapon (usually sword, axe or mace) and bearing chain and shield (AC 17), and if a sorcerer, 1-6 (1d6) apprentices of level 1-6 armed with a minor weapon (dagger) or staff and dressed in robes (AC 12). </p>

        <p>The trader will have a group of 2d6 slaves, of various colors of men, with an equal chance of either sex. These will be sold for 1d100 gp each. In addition, the slaves or guards will carry trade goods five pounds of trade goods; each is worth 1d6 x5 gp. There is a chance that the leader and guards will possess wealth in mixed coins (50%) worth 1d1000 gp, 1d6 gems (10%) worth 1d100 gp each and 1d3 pieces of jewelry (10%) worth 1d1000 gp each. Arms and armor may also be possessed, and ready for sale, there is a 50% that 1d3 lots any particular item on the equipment list will be available. There will almost always be food or water for sale. At the judge’s discretion, there is a small chance (10%) that some item or technological or sorcerous value may be offered for sale. If this is so, such items will only be traded for like items or vast sums of gold, gems or jewelry. </p>

        <p>Note to the Judge: such ‘traders’ will look at every band they encounter with interest. If the player characters are seen as weak, they may be attacked and enslaved. If they are strong, or offer some other reason for forbearance (trade contacts, information) then they will then be treated non-violently. While bargaining is common and expected, true fair dealing is unknown. Some of the trade lots offered may be flawed or damaged in some way that is not immediately obvious. </p>

        <p><strong>Brigands</strong> – This is an armed force of men who prey on others in their local area. The force consists of 5 – 50 (5d10) 1st level men with 1D HP, armed with leather, spear (AC14). Half will have bows or slings. These groups will almost always attempt to kill and plunder any force weaker then themselves. The Judge is encouraged to allow for the possibility of early detection of the brigands and flight for a smaller group of player characters, or the possibility of negotiation or bribery. </p>

        <p>Their leader will be a Fighter (1-5 on 1d6) Roll 1d6 to determine the alignment of the leader. There is a two in six chance for each of the alignments. The leader will usually be armed with a melee weapon and bear chain mail and shield (AC 17) or a two-handed weapon and chain mail (AC 16). </p>

        <p>The leader will usually have 1d6 guards of level 1-6, armed with a melee weapon (usually sword, axe or mace) and bearing chain and shield (AC 17).</p>

        <p>Roll on the race chart to determine the race of the men involved. The alignment of the raiders usually matches that of the ruler.</p>

        <p>There is a chance that the leader and guards will possess loot in mixed coins (50%) worth 1d100 gp, 1d3 gems (10%) worth 1d100 gp each and 1d3 pieces of jewelry (10%) worth 1d1000 gp each.</p>

        <h2 id="monster-lairs">Monster Lairs</h2>

        <p>Use the wandering monster table on page 240 for the type of terrain of the sub-hex (if it has not been determined, decide now) to determine the monster, and then decide on how many creatures are in the lair. Many ‘lairs’ in Carcosa are caves, though this depends largely on the nature of the monster. A herd of dinosaurs, for example, will simply be roaming the area of a particular hex, or the monster might have its den in an abandoned structure of some sort. The number of monsters also depends on the circumstances, but should skew toward the high end of <em>No. Appearing</em> entry for the monster in question. Monster lairs that are inhabited by unintelligent monsters do not generally have treasure, though previous human, snake-men or space alien victims might have left some coins behind (20% chance of 1-100 cp, 1-20 sp, and 1-6 gp, checked individually), or perhaps even a gem/jewelry or an item from the Found Items chart (10% chance, checked individually). </p>

        <h2 id="gathering-of-spawn-of-shub-niggurath">Gathering of Spawn of Shub-Niggurath</h2>

        <p>This is a habitation or other locale where there may be reliably found one of the six species of the spawn of Shub-Niggurath. Instead of rolling randomly, determine the terrain of the hex (if this has not already been determined) and then decide on the most appropriate spawn race. Then roll the <em>No. Appearing</em> entry to determine the size of the habitation.</p>

        <p><strong>Mi-go</strong> – Found mostly on Mountain or hill hexes, and occasionally elsewhere. </p>

        <p><strong>Deep Ones</strong> – Found mostly in seas and lake hexes, but occasionally in dank, wt underground areas. </p>

        <p><strong>B’yakhee</strong> – Found near shrines or holy places to Hastur, but also near gates through space and time, whether natural or artificial. </p>

        <p><strong>Great Race</strong> – Found only in the remnants of their great underground enclaves, far below the earth in their ruined cities. This will usually mean that there is some sort of connection on the surface hex to one of these sites, where they occasionally emerge. </p>

        <p><strong>Primordial Ones</strong> – Found only in their cyclopean ruined cities in the north, and sometimes in a state of suspended animation in ruined enclaves virtually anywhere. </p>

        <p><strong>Shoggoth</strong> – Also found in the ruined cities of the primordial ones, and occasionally in their ruined enclaves. They also might be found assisting the Deep Ones in their cities or enclaves. Occasionally one will inhabit a ruin or temple and receive sacrifices from those trying to control it. </p>

        <p>The Deep Ones, Great Race and Primordial Ones built cities in the past, but only Deep Ones inhabit their cities in any strength (probably because of their ability to interbreed with the 13 races of humanity). Roll the <em>No. Appearing</em> entry and consider any amount over three dozen to be a ‘city’. </p>

        <h2 id="tombs">Tombs</h2>

        <p>Tombs are resting places of the dead. On Carcosa, this state is not as permanent as some would like. While there are not as many conventional undead as a regular D&amp;D campaign, the tombs of Carcosa are still truly frightening. Roll on the following table to determine the nature of the tomb and its inhabitants.</p>

        <table>

        <p><strong>Normal Tomb of Carcosan Men</strong> – This is a simple stone tomb of the Men of Carcosa. Roll on the random race chart to determine the color of the inhabitant. To determine the class of inhabitant, roll 1d6. On a 1-4, it is a fighter, and on a 5-6 it is a sorcerer. If a sorcerer, there is a small chance (20%) of burial while still alive. If the level of the inhabitant matters, roll 2d6 to determine it. There is a chance (35%) that the tomb will have treasure in the form of grave goods equal to 1d1000 gp of various sorts, but this sort of tomb will also invariably have crude traps set in it. A large tomb may (20%) also have several (1d6) sub-tombs of guards, concubines or apprentices, each with its own chance (20%) for a small amount (1d100 gp) of grave-goods. </p>

        <p><strong>Carcosan Mummy Tomb</strong> – Complete information about Carcosan Mummies may be found on page 93 of Carcosa. Though the text of that erudite tome notes that Mummies lie mostly in the tombs of the Radioactive Desert for unknown reasons, it also states that Mummies have traveled far. Inside the Radioactive desert, assume that any tomb is a Mummy tomb, outside of that arid wasteland, it may be assumed that this is the temporary resting place of the mummy, as it dreams its dark visions gifted by Nyarlathotep. </p>

        <p><em>Inside the Radioactive Desert</em> – Each tomb is the lair of 1d6 Mummies (real estate being at a premium there), each has a effective Sorcerer level of 2d6. There is a chance (10%) that a mummy Brain resides here, its effective sorcerer level is usually 2d6+6, unfortunately. If a Mummy brain is present, it will have kicked out all its roommates out of the desire for privacy. </p>

        <p><em>Outside the Radioactive Desert</em> – Each tomb is the lair of a single Mummy with a Sorcerer level of 2d6. Occasionally (10%) 1d3 Mummies will reside here. The Mummy will have taken over another structure as its tomb. Re-roll on the chart above or pick another structure mentioned in these tables. </p>

        <p><strong>Mounds of the Snake-Men</strong> – Snake-men were interred in mounds, sometimes with large, enigmatic earthworks built over their tombs. These structures had some obvious magical purpose, but few Sorcerers today can know what that was. Un-plundered tombs can be treasure troves of artifacts and rituals, graven in glyphs upon slabs of unknown metals, but such places are guarded by curses and enigmatic warders. </p>

        <p><strong>Hibernation Chambers of the Primordial Ones</strong> – In both cold caves and chambers constructed with the weird flesh-mechanics technology of the Primordial Ones, ancient remnants of that long ago race still linger. </p>

        <p>Roll 1d6 or decide based on the location of the hex. </p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>d6</th>
                    <th>Location</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>1-3</td>
                    <td>Frigid Natural Caverns</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>4-6</td>
                    <td>Artificial Hibernation Chamber</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p><em>Frigid Natural Caverns</em> – Here a small (1d6) group of Primordial Ones have become trapped due to long exposure to frigid temperatures. It takes from 1-2 days for the strange beings to thaw out in such circumstances, but when they do, woe betide those who have stolen or misused their property or somehow injured them, thinking that they were dead. </p>

        <p><em>Artificial Hibernation Chamber</em> – The Primordial Ones were not unaware of their race’s ability to hibernate through long stretches of time. At strategic places on Carcosa lie the hibernation chambers of these august entities. Created with flesh-mechanic technologies, these chambers are filled with the pods (1d6) of creatures, who still might have weapons and equipment. While no doubt their chambers are host to their pre-human technological wonders, a fully equipped group of primordial ones is insanely dangerous. </p>

        <p><strong>Long-Sleep Chambers of the Space Aliens</strong> – For unknown reasons, the Space Alien fleet, when it dispersed on Carcosa after its arrival, seeded the surface with outposts and individual craft. These structures and vessels have 1d6 Space aliens in Long-Sleep chambers, ready to be resurrected when the wrong dial is turned or the wrong lever pulled. Space Aliens raised up in this manner are instantly awake, and may quickly turn on their ‘rescuers’ within moments. </p>

        <h2 id="final-steps">Final Steps</h2>

        <p>First, make a note of what resources, sorcerous or otherwise, are available in the greater hex. Usually, the characters will have a 1% cumulative chance to find the resources they are looking for per day of search. This can be herbs, mineral wealth, productive agricultural/pastoral finds (enough to feed a village with regular caretaking and/or husbandry). Other, more general dangers, such as radioactivity should be noted as well. Note any significant or important connections with other hexes not already noted. </p>

        <p>Finally, fill in any terrain hexes not yet completed. Consider adjusting the place or type of feature when something makes more sense after you have completed the greater hex. </p>

        <p>Don’t over expand. In sandbox-style play, for which Carcosa is intended, more than a few lines for each feature is counterproductive. If you mean to publish for profit, then by all means, expand away. But for sharing online or using in your own campaigns, a few lines will do.</p>
