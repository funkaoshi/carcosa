            <p>The serpent-men, originators of sorcery on Carcossa, learned many ways to use human females in their dark rituals. Eventually these rituals were somehow learned by and perverted to the use of human females themselves, who hold a unique appeal to many entities for their ever so slight symbolic relevance to fecundity. The following rituals are, for the most part, only available to those of biologically female physiology and body functions. Like the vast majority of rituals, they are distasteful, dangerous, and powerful.</p>
            <p>These abominable rituals are brought to you by <a href="http://killitwithfirerpg.blogspot.com/" title="Kill It With Fire!">Claytonian JP</a> (<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/113038731865376814003/posts">G+</a>)</p>

                The Hag, an aggregate entity that represents a possible future of all women, will leave information on the future if properly invoked with this ritual. In a dead temple of the serpent-men is a basket of ancient wicker. If a silver dagger, a valuable crystal vial, a ball of golden yarn, the finger-bone of a walking skeleton, and the blood of men from three separate races are put into the basket, and the sorceress spends the night sleeping in the temple, in the morning she will awaken to find in the basket, etched on vellum, clues to any one course of action she has been contemplating. Be warned that The Hag has her own vendetta, and she will lie to you if she thinks it will benefit her.

                The sorceress who would cast this first needs to call up the spirits of the area, and exhort each one to tell of tales of its own fear and sorrow from the days it was alive.  At this point, she must ring the bells of Xavrothis, the dead city. Such bells can be found only in the ruins of Xavrothis, which is a fearsome task in its own right. If the ritual has been done properly thus far, she will hear the howling of the Hounds of Xavrothis in the distance. At this point, the hounds are coming to stalk the streets of the area where the ritual is being cast. The sorceress can protect herself by smearing an unguent made out of ashes, salt-peter, and the sorceress' own fresh menstrual blood upon her skin.

                This ritual needs to be performed in the proximity of an ocean or a body of water with connections to one. The sorcerer must spend two weeks nursing a dozen people of any age or race, who are wrapped in white bindings in such a fashion as to make them look like giant, white worms (eyes, ears, and nose covered, arms bound to body and legs bound together). Each morning, they must be covered liberally in a mix of human blood and the slime from any of Carcosa's varied ooze-like beings. The ritual will mummify them at this point, but the sorceress will use strange necromantic chants and symbols to make sure they can keep suckling. After the two weeks have elapsed, if the sorcery was performed correctly the mummies will burst their bonds and wander off into the cold night, and the body of water this was performed by will become preternaturally cold and foggy. Within 1d4 months, Yikilth, the ice-berg that houses the White Worm will make its way to the area. It will then take up the sorceress to add to its retinue of great sorcerers.

                The sorceress who would cast this ritual must first consult with the spirits of Nug and Yeb, the undead offspring of Shub-Niggurath.  If their shades are properly placated with sacrifices of livestock, nine months later the sorceress will carry a child to term. Upon the night of its birth (and it will be born at night, during a storm) if the sorceress has properly located a wooded area and posted the symbols of The Black Goat, he will appear himself to help deliver and take the child off to an unknown fate. In return, 1d20 trees will reveal their true nature as Childer of Shub-Niggurath.

                In order to reproduce herself, the sorceress creates a perfect, flesh-and-blood simulacra that is animated by the soul of an ancestor. A skeleton from a female of the same race as the sorceress must be wrapped in wrappings that are soaked in human blood and in the dust from a serpent-man tomb. The Sorceress then provides a fingernail, a pint of blood, and no less than thirty hairs pulled out by their roots. At this point, The Doctor, an ancient entity that travels the multiverse performing scientific abominations, will appear and finalize the process, creating a copy of the sorceress out of these parts. Only half of the descriptions of this ritual include a very important part though: The Doctor will kill the original sorceress and start a program of replacing all female members of the local community this way. A symbol that can drive him away after he does desired work can be gleaned by communing with the proper entities though. It is said that the shades of the dreaming tombs of Step may be enticed to give up such information, for instance. In any case, sorceresses that perform this ritual take steps to insure that their soul gets transported to their doppelgangers upon death. One common way to do this is to imprison the doppelganger in a room marked with arcane sigils.

                Scarven's secret ritual is always passed on from one Necromantress on to another. Iniates must agree to consume the remains of aborted feotuses, which are cooked into discreet-looking meat pies. The process is addictive, but for as long as these pies are regularly consumed, the woman that eats them will remain young, and furthermore, will de-age into a beautiful and vital young woman. Even rituals will not age the sorceress. After a month of this, the sorceress is no longer a human, but now an immortal creature. Forever young and beautiful, but sporting a forked tongue and inhuman appetites.

            <p class='description'>
                Using the chants enscribed upon the hide of the undying familiar of Hexatrese the Foul, a necromantess must call upon the ghost of The Whore, an entity that gives up the secrets of the sign to women in return for a sacrifice of three goats and 5 rubies of great value. If the ghost is so placated, it will provide the sign and further ritual steps to be taken, which are: slay a dolm pudding and squeeze the juice from its corpse into a winesack made from human skin etched with runes that prevent its disolution; wait until the night of a new moon and choose the domicile of an enemy; and paint the sign on the southern side of the place using the foul juices  and a brush made from the transparent hairs of a Bone Man. After the sign is painted properly, the curse it brings grows in strength with the waxing of the moon. Each night, there is a chance, equal to the percentage of the illumination of the moon's surface, that a Spawn of Shub-Niggurath will be drawn to the house. Such spawn aim to reproduce via fowl methods that use the bodies of humanoids for incubation and genetic donations.

                Those who dare to enter the temples to the inscrutable female deities of the serpent-men sometimes run into these animate sheers. The sheers fly about on their own accord and can cut through any substance. They will kill any humanoids that enter their territory but if anyone falls to them, they will stop pursuit of other creatures and proceed to cut off strips of flesh from the slain creature. These strips are carried off into the dark realm of The Hag to be turned into vellum.

                A Hound is a fearsome sight: Each limb, canine in form though it may be, ends in a hand with two opposite, opposable thumbs; their gray skin is punctuated by spiky wires in a mockery of hair; their face a leering skull. Once a hound has the scent of prey they can track it, even across dimensions, the barriers of which don't impede a hound. Hounds delight in death and terror. Often, they travel as packs through small towns, terrorizing the citizens for weeks on end and chasing escapees until everyone is dead.

                Rlim Shaikorth, who makes its dwelling upon a mobile iceberg known as Yikilth, comes from a dead empire near the Arctic region of Carcosa. It collects powerful sorcerers of all descriptions as its terrible berg floats throughout the world, but its dwelling can be summoned directly by any sorceress capable of lactating as per the Milk for The White Worm ritual. Rlim itself seeds this ritual and other insane whispers into the dreams of new mothers suffering from post-partum depression. Rlim offers immortality and ineffable arcane knowledge to those that are taken into the icy embrace of the Yikilth berg, and he is attended by a small group of sorcerers that have been deemed worthy of his gifts, as well as other horrors that inhabit the labyrinthine halls of his floating fortress as it makes its way through the coast-land of countless worlds, bringing eternal winter to them all.
                Rlim is nigh invulnerable when conscious, as exhibited by its hit dice, but it is vulnerable when in repose, digesting the souls of those it has consumed. A strike by a good weapon while it is in such a state will bring its death at a terrible price: a near-endless torrent of boiling hot, black blood will rush from it and melt the facility which houses it. Yes folks, this is a load-bearing boss.

                Childer of Shub-niggurath are like the Spawn of Shub-Niggurath in most every way, and the characteristics of each one should be determined randomly, though any one group of them will have the same AC, HD, and psionic powers. All Childer are aboreoids that move by walking on land. They can pass for normal trees during the day, when they stop and lie dormant. They will refuse to harm the sorceress that conjured them, but will destroy any other sentient life on sight. If the sorceress has posted a sign of the Black Goat somewhere, they will head towards it each night. Otherwise they will lie dormant until sentient life provokes their hunger.

                Such doppelgangers are emotionless and effecient beings that strive to be the ideal of perfection, but woe be to the sorceress that lets one out of her sight, for it will surely seduce any partners of the sorceress into killing her so that the femalganger can take her place. A sorceress killed by her lover cannot direct her soul into a doppelganger as usual. Other femalegangers have been know to imprison the original sorceress and take their place.

                The undying familiar is a foul mockery of life: a diminutive homoniculous that is made from the flesh of several men and sporting a mask that conceles a face made of dried blood and twigs. Those who wish to call upon the ghost of The Whore must first find the undying familiar. It is said that if one asks the spirit of an old witch, they will be pointed in the right direction. The undying familiar often spends its time in dead civilizations and deep dungeons, searching for ingreadiants for its long gone mistress. If found and beaten until it can no longer move (and that is the most one can hope to do to a thing that will never die), the chants inscribed upon its flesh can be read and memorized. The familiar is quite quick with a blade. Anybody who is in melee range during a fight will get cut at the start of their turn unless they make a good save. People fumbling such a save lose an eye to the blade. If defeated, the undying familiar will regenerate 1 HD a week.
