Random Carcosa
==============

This website generates random hex descriptions in the vein of the RPG book [Carcosa][1]. [You can learn more about Carcosa on my blog.][2] If you aren't interested in RPGs and Hex Crawls and junk like that this isn't going to be a particularly interesting project.

This is a little hobby project. The code could probably be much better, and there should be unit tests for all the pieces that make it go. That said, it works well enough and f you haven't seen a flask project before it might be informative.

TODO:

 * Store generated hex descriptions so people can refer back to them later.
 * Let users describe the races / monsters they expect in their world, and then generate a hex crawl suitable for that world, rather than Carcosa. (Swap out the races of men, etc.)
