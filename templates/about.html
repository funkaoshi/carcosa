<h1>About</h1>
<div class='write-up'>
<p><a href="http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/products/carcosa"><em>Carcosa</em></a>, by Geoffrey McKinney, is ostensibly a campaign setting for Dungeons and Dragons. <em>Carcosa</em> was originally released as a stapled booklet entitled <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Supplement V: Carcosa</em>. Both the name and its form were a homage to the <a href="http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/original.html">original 1974 D&amp;D books</a>. The book was re-released by <a href="http://lotfp.com/">Lamentations of the Flame Princess</a>, and is a much grander affair. <a href="http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=145">As a physical object <em>Carcosa</em> is nothing short of perfection.</a></p>
<p>This website is my homage to <em>Carcosa</em>. It's goal is to generate a <a href="/random/">additional hex descriptions</a> for <em>Carcosa</em> that are in the same vein as those found in the book. I am also using this site to write about my gaming experiences with <em>Carcosa</em>. (For example, <a href="/1807/">here is a <em>Carcosa</em> style play report</a>.)</p>
<p>This website's layout mirrors the book as best I can. The title font is <a href="http://www.azfonts.net/load_font/02-114-FontsPack.html">Art-Nouvea Bistro by Gophmann A.L.</a>, and I hope it is in fact free.</p>
<p>Most of the content on this site comes from myself, but others have contributed hex descriptions, ideas, and the like. I'm using the name generator from the <a href="http://www.apolitical.info/carcosa/">Carcosa Grimoire</a>, by Andrew Byers. Additional 'weird' hex descriptions come from: <a href="http://untimately.blogspot.ca/">Brendan Strejcek</a>, <a href="http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.ca/">Gus L</a>.</p>
